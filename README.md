## About the Project

 This site displays virtual currencies and gives you the ability to see live reports of their value.

### Home Page

This is where you can see the coins. If you click "more info," you can see a picture of the coin as well its value. You can select up to five coins to see a graph with live reports of their value. 

### Live Reports Page

This page displays the graph with each of the coins that you've selected. The graph will display the value of the coins every two seconds.
